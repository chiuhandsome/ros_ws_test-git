## Introduction

This package contains PNP ROS bridge.

ROS hydro/indigo/kinetic (catkin) version.


## How to compile pnp_ros and examples (rp_action)



Add links from the folders in PNPros to your catkin workspace.
For example

    catkin_ws/src$ ln -s <path_to_PNP>/PNPros/ROS_bridge/pnp_ros .
    catkin_ws/src$ ln -s <path_to_PNP>/PNPros/ROS_bridge/pnp_msgs .
    catkin_ws/src$ ln -s <path_to_PNP>/PNPros/ROS_bridge/rp_action .
    catkin_ws/src$ ln -s <path_to_PNP>/PNPros/ROS_bridge/rp_action_msgs .

and run '''catkin_make''' from your catkin workspace
to compile the ROS packages related to PNPros
and some examples.

Note: If some errors occur during build like: 
'''fatal error: pnp_msgs/Action.h: No such file or directory'''

try to build the msgs first:
catkin_make --pkg pnp_msgs
